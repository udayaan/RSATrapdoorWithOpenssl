Description:
There are five programs:

Algorithm used for sysmmetric encryption : AES128 CBC

gen_rand.c :
It generates a random number using the rand() function. The user is expected to pass the 
length of the key and the filename of the key. This random number is encrypted using the 
openssl EVP encrypt function. The number is also signed using the openssl HMAC functions.
The signature is stored in home directory with .sign extension.

fput_encrypt_rsa.c :
The user passes the file path to random number generated using gen_rand.c, the path where the 
encrypted message is stored, the public key file path of the receiver and the message content
as input through stdin. 
This program decrypts the random number, verifies the signature of the random number, uses
key to encrypt the message, creates HMAC signature of message using openssl HMAC functions,
reads the public key passed and uses this key to encrypt the random number in different 
file and creates signature of this random number using HMAC functions.

fget_decrypt_rsa.c :
Uses the openssl RSA_private_decrypt function to decrypt the key. Then uses the openssl
EVP decrypt function to decrypt the message using the decrypted key. The signature of both the 
key and the message are verified using the EVP HMAC  functions.

fsign.c :
Uses the openssl HMAC functions to create signature of text passed to it. Saves the signed file 
using .sign extension.

fverify.c :
Uses the openssl HMAC functions to verify the signature of the file passed.


Usage Example:

Type make in terminal to compile all the programs.

Generate private key in PEM format:
openssl genrsa -out private.pem 2048

Genrate Public key in PEM format:
openssl rsa -in private.pem -outform PEM -pubout -out public.pem

Sender Generates a random number and stores it in a file:
./gen_rand.o 16 file

Encrypt: 
./fput_encrypt_rsa.o /home/file public.pem /home/enc1 /home/key  < input

Decrypt:
./fget_decrypt_rsa.o /home/key private.pem /home/enc1


Assumptions:
1. gen_rand can generate numbers up to the length of 19.
2. gen_rand expects user to enter the file name only where the 
random number should be stored. All the random number files
stored in home directory.
3. no file named temp should be created inside the fprogram files folder.
4. message input needs to be provided through redirection '<' in the terminal.
The user/sender is expected to delete this plaintext message file after encryption 
is done. 
5. All ACL Assumptions are same as in the previous assignment.
6. Assuming DAC permissions allowed for private and public keys.


Defense: 
1) Program terminates gracefully when invalid pubkey/private keys or 
invalid arguments are provided.

Example:
./fget_decrypt_rsa.o /home/key  /home/enc1
output: Invalid arguments

2) The random numbers generated are stored in a file in the home directory.
These files have only read-write permissions to the owner of the file.
permissions to read and write should be provided by the owner/ Sender 
through setacl.o program.

3) Successful working of protection through acls. If sender doesn't give read
 or write permissions, no other user can Decrypt the encrypted files.

Example: Encrypt a file using any user and decrypt using another user.

4) Even if attacker tries to use do_exec.o to decrypt the encrypted files to
which he/she has no permissions, permission denied is printed on the terminal.

Example: Encrypt a file using any user and decrypt using another user with use 
of do_exec.o program.

Ensure that the receiver has atleast read permission to the new key file, the encrypted
file and the private key.
To set the permissions use /setacl.o -m o::r-- <filename>

5) If attacker tries to modify any file which is encrypted, the signature verification step
will fail indicating an attack.
