The fread() function in C++ reads the block of data from stream. This function first, reads count number of objects, each one with a size of size bytes from the given input stream. The total amount of bytes read, if successful is ( size*count ). According to the no. of characters read, the indicator file position is incremented. If the objects read are not trivially copy-able, then the behavior is undefined and if the value of size or count is equal to zero, then this program will simply return 0.1010101010
